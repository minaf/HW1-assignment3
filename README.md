# Neural network for image classification

## Files
- network1.py - using one hidden layer. Different values of paramters learning rate, batch size and iteration number is checked using this code 
- network2.py - using two hidden layers. Defined momentum to speed up training. 
- network3.py - using convolutional layer and two hidden layers.
